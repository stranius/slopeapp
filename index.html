		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>The application above is presented in an iframe, the files being stored in another folder and displayed in the iframe.</p>
		<p>To make this application, I used an SVG html tag with javascript to control it. After some research, it seemed that many of the applets seen on explorables were made using this format.</p>
